<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, everyone! My name is Angel Samaniego, and I'm here learning web develpoing to start me on a new careeer path.</p>
<p>Most of my work life I have done construction. Now I am trying to venture out and learn a whole new set of skills I know nothing about. Although it is a little daunting, not being a tech savy guy and all, I am very much looking forward to learning everything this course has to offer.</p>

<p>I enjoy watching anime whener i have some free time.My music taste is pretty open, but i mainly listen to pop punk or anything in the metalcore genre. I have trained jiu jitsu for a few years and love the sport very much.</p>
